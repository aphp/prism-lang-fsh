## Development Process

### Language Definition Guidelines

When working on the language definition:

1. **Study existing Prism.js language definitions** for patterns
2. **Follow Prism.js conventions**:
   - Use appropriate token names
   - Keep patterns efficient
   - Avoid catastrophic backtracking
3. **Test thoroughly** with various code samples
4. **Document any special cases** or limitations

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```

#### Visual Testing
```bash
npm run test:visual
# Opens a browser to manually test highlighting
```

#### Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Building

```bash
# Development build
npm run build:dev

# Production build (minified)
npm run build
```

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or corrections
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for multiline comments
fix: resolve issue with string escaping
docs: update installation instructions
```

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep lines under 100 characters

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Processes a token pattern
 * @param {string} pattern - The pattern to process
 * @returns {RegExp} The compiled regular expression
 */
function processPattern(pattern) {
  return new RegExp(pattern, 'g');
}
```

### Regular Expression Guidelines

When writing patterns for the language definition:

1. **Optimize for performance**: Avoid backtracking
2. **Use non-capturing groups**: `(?:...)` when you don't need the match
3. **Be specific**: Avoid overly broad patterns
4. **Test edge cases**: Empty strings, special characters, etc.
5. **Comment complex patterns**:

```javascript
// Matches string literals with escaped characters
string: {
  pattern: /(["'])(?:\\.|(?!\1)[^\\\r\n])*\1/,
  greedy: true
}
```

## Project Structure Guidelines

### File Organization

- `src/`: Source code only
- `test/`: All test files and fixtures
- `examples/`: Working examples
- `dist/`: Built files (don't commit)
- `docs/`: Additional documentation

### Naming Conventions

- Files: `kebab-case.js`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- CSS classes: `kebab-case`

## Documentation
